# AGENTS Instructions

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Development Guidelines
- Follow the project requirements in `PRD_0618.md`.
- Use Phaser 3 and JavaScript (ES6+) for game code.
- Keep the recommended folder structure from the PRD when adding files.
- Write modular code: scenes, objects, managers, etc.
- Update `project_plan.md` with a short note describing progress in each commit.
- Commit messages should be concise and in English.
- If a `package.json` exists with test scripts, run `npm test` before committing and ensure it passes.
- In case of merge conflicts, always keep the incoming changes.
  The latest code is considered the source of truth and may overwrite
  existing content automatically to avoid conflicts.

## Documentation
- Keep documentation in Markdown.
