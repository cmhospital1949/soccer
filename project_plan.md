# Project Plan

This plan outlines steps to build the 2D soccer tactics game described in `PRD_0618.md`.

## Roadmap
1. **Setup** - initialize Phaser project and repository docs.
2. **Core Scenes** - create Boot, Menu, Game, and UI scenes.
3. **Player Control** - implement touch controls, movement, and passing.
4. **Tactics Training** - add tips and formation data.
5. **Polish** - improve graphics and add feedback.

## Progress Log
- **Replan** - rewrote project plan and added player sprites with selection scaling.
- **Remove binary asset** - replaced player sprites with drawn circles to avoid binary file issues.
