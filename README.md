Simple 2D soccer tactics demo built with Phaser 3.

## How to Run
1. Launch a local web server (for example, the VSCode Live Server extension) and open `index.html`.
2. From the menu, choose **Start Game** or **Tactics Planning**. The options highlight when hovered so you know they are clickable.

## Controls
- Tap a player to select them. The selected player grows slightly.
- Tap the field to move the selected player.
- If the selected player has the ball, tap a teammate to pass.
- A goal is scored when the ball crosses either edge of the field.
  The score is shown at the top of the screen.

Visit **Tactics Planning** from the main menu to read basic tips about
using open space and making passes.

The demo loads two teams with a 4-4-2 formation (11 players each) so you can experiment with basic positioning.
